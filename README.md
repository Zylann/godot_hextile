Hextile demo for Godot Engine
==================================

This is partial port of [hextile-demo](https://github.com/mmikk/hextile-demo) for Godot Engine.
Supports normal maps.

This is only a demo and might need a bit of integration work to fit in actual projects like a plugin. I just wanted to have it somewhere to share.
